\section{Conclusions}
%
Being marketed as a solution that allows for the ``removal
of even the cloud provider from the Trusted Computing
Base''~\cite{confcon2022marketing}, which has
caught the attention of customers who need an additional layer of protection for
intellectual property, sensitive data, or for regulatory compliance in data
protection, confidential computing is becoming a mainstream technology for
cloud-based services.
% When it comes to cloud deployments, TEEs can also be leveraged to comply
% with regulations such as GDPR.
%
However, our research shows that, today, the promised security guarantees are
far from reality as cloud providers still play a crucial role in the deployment
and management of confidential workloads, especially regarding the latest trend
with confidential virtual machines. Yet, customers that are willing to trust the
CSPs can still benefit from current offerings as a defense-in-depth mechanism
for strong hardware-rooted isolation from other tenants and the hypervisor.
%
We also notice a joint effort between cloud providers and organizations such as
the Confidential Computing Consortium and the IETF, as well as the open source
community, to enhance current confidential computing solutions. Here,
researchers can play an important role and nudge actors towards more principled
security.
